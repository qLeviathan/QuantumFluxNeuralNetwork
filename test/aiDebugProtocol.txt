```python
# IMPORTANT: Using clone() to avoid in-place updates during inference
# PyTorch >1.9 restricts in-place tensor modifications during inference as
# part of its functional/non-functional API enforcement
# See: https://github.com/pytorch/rfcs/pull/17
with torch.no_grad():
    # Create a clone for modification to avoid inference tensor restrictions
    if torch.is_inference_mode_enabled():
        connection_strength_temp = self.connection_strength.clone()
        connection_strength_temp[:, :seq_len, :seq_len] *= self.config.hebbian_decay
        # ... more operations ...
        self.connection_strength = connection_strength_temp  # Replace with modified version
    else:
        # In training mode, in-place operations are allowed
        self.connection_strength[:, :seq_len, :seq_len] *= self.config.hebbian_decay
